# üõ†Ô∏è Installing Flathub and Skype on Ubuntu 24.04

Welcome to the guide for setting up Flathub on Ubuntu 24.04 and installing Skype using Flatpak. Follow these steps to enjoy a seamless installation process.

## üìã Prerequisites

- A system running Ubuntu 24.04 or later.
- Administrative (sudo) access to your system.

## Step 1: Install Flatpak

Flatpak is included in the software sources of Ubuntu 18.10 and later. To install it, open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt install flatpak
```

For older versions of Ubuntu (up to 18.04 LTS), you need to add the official Flatpak PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:flatpak/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install flatpak
```

## Step 2: Install the GNOME Software Flatpak Plugin

The GNOME Software plugin allows you to install Flatpak apps without using the command line. Install it by running:

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
```

**Note:** On Ubuntu versions 20.04 to 23.04, GNOME Software is distributed as a Snap package and does not support Flatpak apps. Installing this plugin will install a deb version of GNOME Software, resulting in two "Software" apps being installed. For Ubuntu 23.10 and newer, a single new "Software" app will be installed.

## Step 3: Add the Flathub Repository

Flathub is the go-to repository for Flatpak apps. To enable it, run:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

## Step 4: Restart Your System

Restart your system to finalize the setup:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Step 5: Install Skype

Once Flatpak and Flathub are set up, you can easily install Skype by running:

```bash
flatpak install flathub com.skype.Client
```

## Step 6: Launch Skype

To launch Skype after installation, run the following command in the terminal or search for "Skype" in your application menu:

```bash
flatpak run com.skype.Client
```
